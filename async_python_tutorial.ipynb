    "# Async in Python: A Practical Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `asyncio` library enables asynchronous programming, allowing you to write non-blocking code that handles many tasks at once. This tutorial covers the fundamentals through advanced concepts with engaging examples and exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Why Asynchronous Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional synchronous code executes line by line, waiting for each task to finish. When operations involve waiting—like network requests or file I/O—this can slow down your program. Asynchronous code allows the program to continue running other tasks while waiting, improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine ordering food at a restaurant. In a synchronous world, the waiter would take one person's order, wait in the kitchen until it's ready, deliver the meal, then return to take the next order. Asynchronous service lets the waiter take multiple orders, deliver meals as they're ready, and keep everyone happy and fed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Event Loop and Coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "`asyncio` relies on an **event loop**, a cycle that schedules and runs tasks. Functions defined with `async def` are **coroutines**, which can pause at `await` points so other tasks can run.\n",

    "2. **Progress Indicator**: Write a coroutine that prints \".\" every half second while another coroutine performs a slow operation (like `asyncio.sleep(5)`). Use `asyncio.gather` to run them together.\n",
    "3. **Timeouts**: Implement a wrapper that cancels a coroutine if it takes longer than a specified number of seconds.\n",
    "4. **Chat Server (Advanced)**: Build a tiny chat server using `asyncio` sockets where multiple clients can send messages to each other.\n",
    "5. **Async File Processing**: Use `aiofiles` to read several files concurrently and count the total lines across them.\n",
