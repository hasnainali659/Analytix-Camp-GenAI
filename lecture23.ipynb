The potential risks of operative intervention discussed with the patient included but were not limited to the\\ngeneral operative risks of death, bleeding, and infection. In addition, the patient was advised that surgical procedures\\ninvolving this segment of the spine could also result in paralysis, loss of bowel and bladder function, loss of sexual\\nfunction, as well as changes in sensation in the extremities that could include pain, numbness, tingling, and burning\\nwhich could be temporary or permanent. The patient was advised of the possibility of a spinal fluid leak which could\\nrequire additional intervention. The patient was counseled that the surgical procedure may fail to relieve his or her\\nsymptoms or could potentially make his or her symptoms worse. The potential benefit of operative intervention would\\nbe to achieve a reduction in the severity of the patient\\'s symptoms.\\nDouglas Carl Crowther, DO\\nPrinted by 23573 at 4/2/24  9:28 AM Page 13\\nElectronically signed by Douglas Carl Crowther, DO at 10/30/2023  8:17 AM\\nH&P - Filed on 10/31/2023 1550\\nH&P by Douglas Carl Crowther, DO at 10/30/2023 0817\\nEditor: Douglas Carl Crowther, DO (Physician)\\nStopped in Visit\\nVersion 1 of 1\\nVersion 1 of 1\\nAuthor: Douglas Carl Crowther, DO Service: Orthopedics Author Type: Physician\\nFiled: 10/30/2023  8:17 AM Date of Service: 10/30/2023  8:17 AM Status: Signed\\nDiscontinued on: 11/3/2023\\nReason for discontinuation: Stop Taking at Discharge\\nDiscontinued by: Jack Nicholas Torres, MD Discontinued on: 11/22/2023\\nReason for discontinuation: Stop Taking at Discharge\\nInstructions: Take 1 tablet (5 mg) by mouth daily.\\nAuthorized by: Camilla Monteiro, DO Ordered on: 11/3/2023\\nStart date: 11/3/2023\\nScan on 10/31/2023  3:50 PM: CROWTHER, DOUGLAS CARL (below)\\nEnd date: 11/22/2023\\nQuantity: 30 tablet Refill: 1 refill by 11/1/2024\\naspirin 81 MG chewable tablet\\nDiscontinued by: Brianne Elizabeth Wagner, NP\\nST FRANCIS_R_000013\\n\\nSt. Francis Medical Center\\n6001 E Woodmen Rd\\nColorado Springs CO 80923-2601\\nGallardo, Jesus Michael Jr. \"Jes\"\\nMRN: CEUL0641381, DOB: 5/1/1942, Sex: M\\nAdm: 10/30/2023, D/C: 11/3/2023\\n10/30/2023 - Admission (Discharged) in St. Francis Medical Center 6N Ortho/Surg (continued)\\nCDI Queries (continued)\\nTreatment Team\\nPrinted by 23573 at 4/2/24  9:28 AM Page  6\\nProvider Service Role Provider Team Specialty From To\\nDouglas Carl\\nCrowther, DO\\nSurgery Attending — Orthopedic\\nSurgery\\n10/30/23 0614 11/03/23 1800\\nKandra S\\nKendall, PT\\n— Physical\\nTherapist\\n— Physical Therapy 11/03/23 0950 —\\nTara Crews, OT — Occupational\\nTherapist\\n— Occupational\\nTherapy\\n11/03/23 0809 11/03/23 1617\\nSara Cook — Utilization\\nReview Nurse\\n— — 11/03/23 0801 —\\nErica Czufin,\\nLCSW\\n— Social Worker — Social Services 11/03/23 0745 11/03/23 1630\\nMia Velarde,\\nPharmacist\\n— Pharmacist — — 11/03/23 0739 —\\nEmily A Cai,\\nPharmacist\\nMedicine Pharmacist — Pharmacy 11/03/23 0738 11/03/23 1638\\nChelsey Vincent,\\nRN\\n— Registered\\nNurse\\n— — 11/03/23 0721 —\\nAbigail Simonton — Certified Nursing\\nAssistant\\n— — 11/03/23 0720 —\\nCheyenne Staab — Certified Nursing\\nAssistant\\n— — 11/02/23 2036 11/03/23 0906\\nElissa Watson,\\nRN\\n— Registered\\nNurse\\n— — 11/02/23 2008 11/03/23 0715\\nAmy L Plouffe — Certified Nursing — — 11/02/23 1913 11/02/23 1916\\nSubject: Accuity CDI Clarification 360 DX\\n Please provide a diagnosis as an addendum to the discharge summary corresponding to the clinical\\nevidence listed below such as:\\n_Spinal cord edema presents on admission related to severe canal stenosis with mass effect requiring\\ntreatment with/by IV dexamethasone, Incision/drainage.\\n_Other, with explanation of clinical findings.\\n_Clinically undetermined.\\nClinical Indicators: Impaired balance/sensation, weakness to core and BLEs. 9 x 14 x 90 mm (AP x TV x\\nCC) dorsal epidural hematoma extending from T5-T9, largest at T8 … associated severe canal stenosis,\\nmass effect on the spinal cord spanning T7-T8.

Patient had not taken her morning blood pressure medication and had\\nslightly elevated blood pressure and preoperative area.  Anesthesia gave approval and clearance to move forward\\nwith surgical intervention is felt that blood pressure could be well controlled during surgical procedure with appropriate\\nmedication.\\nThe surgical procedure and placement of the spinal cord stimulator was uneventful and completed without\\ncomplication.  Patient was transferred to the PACU and was doing well within recovery.  Approximately 3 hours post\\nsurgery patient was standing at bedside without complaints of leg weakness or numbness.  Within the next hour, at 4\\nhours postop my staff was notified that the patient was having weakness and decreased sensation in his lower\\nextremities.  I immediately presented to the hospital for evaluation of the patient.  Patient was without motor function of\\nhis bilateral lower extremities as well as loss of sensation.  At this point the patient was taken back to the operating\\nroom emergently for evacuation of suspected epidural hematoma and removal of spinal cord stimulator.  During his\\npostoperative course in PACU patient had unresponsive blood pressure.  Patient had consistent blood pressure\\nsystolic 180- 240.  Multiple attempts by anesthesia as well as consult with hospitalist with different medications to treat\\npatient\\'s blood pressure.  It is presumed that the patient\\'s elevated systolic blood pressure postoperatively contributed\\nto development of epidural hematoma at the surgical field.\\nPost procedure patient noticed improvement of his symptoms continued to have some weakness of his lower\\nextremities.  A subsequent MRI was obtained this was delayed due to the fact that there was concern for metal within\\nthe patient\\'s body and multiple attempts at MRI were completed.  MRI was finally obtained there was found to be an\\nepidural hematoma more cephalad to the surgical site.  At this point time after discussion with neurosurgery colleague\\nbest surgical solution would be to return to the OR for evacuation of epidural hematoma via bilateral hemilaminotomies\\nas well as placement of permanent spinal cord stimulator for treatment of chronic pain and neuropathy that would\\nensue\\nClinical Indicators: Impaired balance/sensation, weakness to core and BLEs. 9 x 14 x 90 mm (AP x TV x CC) dorsal\\nepidural hematoma extending from T5-T9, largest at T8 … associated severe canal stenosis, mass effect on the spinal\\ncord spanning T7-T8.

The potential risks of operative intervention discussed with the patient included but were not limited to the\\ngeneral operative risks of death, bleeding, and infection. In addition, the patient was advised that surgical procedures\\ninvolving this segment of the spine could also result in paralysis, loss of bowel and bladder function, loss of sexual\\nfunction, as well as changes in sensation in the extremities that could include pain, numbness, tingling, and burning\\nwhich could be temporary or permanent. The patient was advised of the possibility of a spinal fluid leak which could\\nrequire additional intervention. The patient was counseled that the surgical procedure may fail to relieve his or her\\nsymptoms or could potentially make his or her symptoms worse. The potential benefit of operative intervention would\\nbe to achieve a reduction in the severity of the patient\\'s symptoms.\\nDouglas Carl Crowther, DO\\nPrinted by 23573 at 4/2/24  9:28 AM Page 13\\nElectronically signed by Douglas Carl Crowther, DO at 10/30/2023  8:17 AM\\nH&P - Filed on 10/31/2023 1550\\nH&P by Douglas Carl Crowther, DO at 10/30/2023 0817\\nEditor: Douglas Carl Crowther, DO (Physician)\\nStopped in Visit\\nVersion 1 of 1\\nVersion 1 of 1\\nAuthor: Douglas Carl Crowther, DO Service: Orthopedics Author Type: Physician\\nFiled: 10/30/2023  8:17 AM Date of Service: 10/30/2023  8:17 AM Status: Signed\\nDiscontinued on: 11/3/2023\\nReason for discontinuation: Stop Taking at Discharge\\nDiscontinued by: Jack Nicholas Torres, MD Discontinued on: 11/22/2023\\nReason for discontinuation: Stop Taking at Discharge\\nInstructions: Take 1 tablet (5 mg) by mouth daily.\\nAuthorized by: Camilla Monteiro, DO Ordered on: 11/3/2023\\nStart date: 11/3/2023\\nScan on 10/31/2023  3:50 PM: CROWTHER, DOUGLAS CARL (below)\\nEnd date: 11/22/2023\\nQuantity: 30 tablet Refill: 1 refill by 11/1/2024\\naspirin 81 MG chewable tablet\\nDiscontinued by: Brianne Elizabeth Wagner, NP\\nST FRANCIS_R_000013\\n\\nSt. Francis Medical Center\\n6001 E Woodmen Rd\\nColorado Springs CO 80923-2601\\nGallardo, Jesus Michael Jr. \"Jes\"\\nMRN: CEUL0641381, DOB: 5/1/1942, Sex: M\\nAdm: 10/30/2023, D/C: 11/3/2023\\n10/30/2023 - Admission (Discharged) in St. Francis Medical Center 6N Ortho/Surg (continued)\\nCDI Queries (continued)\\nTreatment Team\\nPrinted by 23573 at 4/2/24  9:28 AM Page  6\\nProvider Service Role Provider Team Specialty From To\\nDouglas Carl\\nCrowther, DO\\nSurgery Attending — Orthopedic\\nSurgery\\n10/30/23 0614 11/03/23 1800\\nKandra S\\nKendall, PT\\n— Physical\\nTherapist\\n— Physical Therapy 11/03/23 0950 —\\nTara Crews, OT — Occupational\\nTherapist\\n— Occupational\\nTherapy\\n11/03/23 0809 11/03/23 1617\\nSara Cook — Utilization\\nReview Nurse\\n— — 11/03/23 0801 —\\nErica Czufin,\\nLCSW\\n— Social Worker — Social Services 11/03/23 0745 11/03/23 1630\\nMia Velarde,\\nPharmacist\\n— Pharmacist — — 11/03/23 0739 —\\nEmily A Cai,\\nPharmacist\\nMedicine Pharmacist — Pharmacy 11/03/23 0738 11/03/23 1638\\nChelsey Vincent,\\nRN\\n— Registered\\nNurse\\n— — 11/03/23 0721 —\\nAbigail Simonton — Certified Nursing\\nAssistant\\n— — 11/03/23 0720 —\\nCheyenne Staab — Certified Nursing\\nAssistant\\n— — 11/02/23 2036 11/03/23 0906\\nElissa Watson,\\nRN\\n— Registered\\nNurse\\n— — 11/02/23 2008 11/03/23 0715\\nAmy L Plouffe — Certified Nursing — — 11/02/23 1913 11/02/23 1916\\nSubject: Accuity CDI Clarification 360 DX\\n Please provide a diagnosis as an addendum to the discharge summary corresponding to the clinical\\nevidence listed below such as:\\n_Spinal cord edema presents on admission related to severe canal stenosis with mass effect requiring\\ntreatment with/by IV dexamethasone, Incision/drainage.\\n_Other, with explanation of clinical findings.\\n_Clinically undetermined.\\nClinical Indicators: Impaired balance/sensation, weakness to core and BLEs. 9 x 14 x 90 mm (AP x TV x\\nCC) dorsal epidural hematoma extending from T5-T9, largest at T8 … associated severe canal stenosis,\\nmass effect on the spinal cord spanning T7-T8.

Patient had not taken her morning blood pressure medication and had\\nslightly elevated blood pressure and preoperative area.  Anesthesia gave approval and clearance to move forward\\nwith surgical intervention is felt that blood pressure could be well controlled during surgical procedure with appropriate\\nmedication.\\nThe surgical procedure and placement of the spinal cord stimulator was uneventful and completed without\\ncomplication.  Patient was transferred to the PACU and was doing well within recovery.  Approximately 3 hours post\\nsurgery patient was standing at bedside without complaints of leg weakness or numbness.  Within the next hour, at 4\\nhours postop my staff was notified that the patient was having weakness and decreased sensation in his lower\\nextremities.  I immediately presented to the hospital for evaluation of the patient.  Patient was without motor function of\\nhis bilateral lower extremities as well as loss of sensation.  At this point the patient was taken back to the operating\\nroom emergently for evacuation of suspected epidural hematoma and removal of spinal cord stimulator.  During his\\npostoperative course in PACU patient had unresponsive blood pressure.  Patient had consistent blood pressure\\nsystolic 180- 240.  Multiple attempts by anesthesia as well as consult with hospitalist with different medications to treat\\npatient\\'s blood pressure.  It is presumed that the patient\\'s elevated systolic blood pressure postoperatively contributed\\nto development of epidural hematoma at the surgical field.\\nPost procedure patient noticed improvement of his symptoms continued to have some weakness of his lower\\nextremities.  A subsequent MRI was obtained this was delayed due to the fact that there was concern for metal within\\nthe patient\\'s body and multiple attempts at MRI were completed.  MRI was finally obtained there was found to be an\\nepidural hematoma more cephalad to the surgical site.  At this point time after discussion with neurosurgery colleague\\nbest surgical solution would be to return to the OR for evacuation of epidural hematoma via bilateral hemilaminotomies\\nas well as placement of permanent spinal cord stimulator for treatment of chronic pain and neuropathy that would\\nensue\\nClinical Indicators: Impaired balance/sensation, weakness to core and BLEs. 9 x 14 x 90 mm (AP x TV x CC) dorsal\\nepidural hematoma extending from T5-T9, largest at T8 … associated severe canal stenosis, mass effect on the spinal\\ncord spanning T7-T8.

       " HumanMessage(content='Your medical summary for Jesus Michael Gallardo Jr. is comprehensive and covers most of the critical aspects of the patient\\'s hospital stay and discharge plan. However, there are areas where clarity and additional details could enhance the summary\\'s effectiveness. Here are some critiques and recommendations:\\n\\n1. **Clarity and Consistency:**\\n   - Ensure consistency in the use of medical terminology. For example, you mention \"epidural hematoma\" and \"dorsal epidural hematoma.\" It would be beneficial to clarify if these terms refer to the same condition or different aspects of the patient\\'s complications.\\n   - The summary mentions \"permanent stimulator placement\" twice, once as part of the initial surgery and again after the second surgery. Clarify whether the stimulator was re-placed after the hematoma evacuation or if the initial placement was considered permanent.\\n\\n2. **Detailed Timeline:**\\n   - Provide a clearer timeline of events, especially regarding the surgeries and interventions. For instance, specify the dates and times of the initial surgery, the onset of complications, the emergency intervention, and the subsequent MRI and second surgery.\\n\\n3. **Medical History:**\\n   - While you list the patient\\'s medical history, it would be helpful to indicate how these conditions were managed during the hospital stay. For example, mention any specific adjustments made to the patient\\'s medication regimen due to the surgeries or complications.\\n\\n4. **Treatment and Management:**\\n   - Expand on the rationale for using specific medications, such as IV dexamethasone, and how they contributed to the patient\\'s recovery.\\n   - Include any specific findings from the physical and occupational therapy evaluations that might have influenced the discharge plan.\\n\\n5. **Discharge Plan:**\\n   - Elaborate on the goals of the rehabilitation at Capron Acute Rehab Center. What specific therapies or interventions are planned to address the patient\\'s lower extremity weakness?\\n   - Mention any follow-up appointments or specific specialists the patient needs to see post-discharge.\\n\\n6. **Support System:**\\n   - While you mention the support system, it would be beneficial to include any specific roles or responsibilities the family members will have in the patient\\'s recovery process.\\n\\n7. **Formatting and Structure:**\\n   - Consider using bullet points or subheadings to break down complex sections, such as the hospital course and discharge plan, for easier readability.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the summary will provide a more comprehensive and clear picture of the patient\\'s hospital experience and future care needs.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='f43e5a89-ef94-4701-9729-0960f15035d6'),\n",
