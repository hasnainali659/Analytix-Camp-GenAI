Users increas-\\ningly prefer to interact with these systems through natural language\\nqueries—posing questions as they would to another person—making\\nit essential for retrieval technologies to understand and process\\nlanguage in a human-like manner [ 4, 5]. Large language models\\n(LLMs) are integral to these systems for interpreting user queries ac-\\ncurately. However, LLMs face several challenges that impact their\\nability to retrieve relevant information effectively. Firstly, these\\nmodels often struggle to fully comprehend the context embedded\\nwithin questions, which can lead to responses that do not align\\nprecisely with the user’s intentions. Furthermore, language models\\nencounter challenges related to \"hallucinating\" information, i.e.,\\ngenerating entirely fictional facts. Another issue is that the train-\\ning datasets may not be updated regularly, potentially leading to\\nincorrect outputs. To address these challenges, one effective ap-\\nproach is using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which\\nintegrates the advantages of retrieval-based methods to access up-\\nto-date information with generation-based models for coherent and\\ncontext-aware responses. This hybrid method helps mitigate issues\\nrelated to outdated data and enhances the model’s ability to provide\\naccurate and relevant information.\\nTo further advance beyond the traditional RAG framework, Graph-\\nRAG introduces a novel enhancement by integrating knowledge\\ngraphs (KGs). By leveraging the structured relationships and rich\\nsemantics within knowledge graphs, GraphRAG not only improves\\nthe retrieval process but also enables more nuanced and contextu-\\nally aware responses. This incorporation of KGs allows the model\\nto understand complex queries better and provide more detailed\\nand interconnected information, thereby pushing the boundaries\\nof what RAG frameworks can achieve.\\nKG is a structured representation of knowledge that captures\\nrelationships between data points within a specific domain. This\\nstructure is composed of nodes that represent entities and edges\\nthat depict the relationships between these entities, forming an\\ninterconnected information. KGs are effective tools for organizing\\nand integrating vast amounts of data from various sources, enhanc-\\ning the accessibility and usability of this information. They play a\\ncrucial role in improving search engines by providing structured,\\ninterconnected search results, thereby offering users more relevant\\nand comprehensive answers [1, 10]. Moreover, KGs are essential\\nin advancing artificial intelligence applications, including recom-\\nmendation systems and natural language processing, by supplying\\na robust framework for understanding context and semantics. By\\nserving as a structured source of information, KGs help reduce\\nhallucinations in LLMs, leading to more accurate and reliable out-\\nputs [6, 15].\\narXiv:2409.17580v1  [cs.IR]  26 Sep 2024'"

Large language models\\n(LLMs) are integral to these systems for interpreting user queries ac-\\ncurately. However, LLMs face several challenges that impact their\\nability to retrieve relevant information effectively. Firstly, these\\nmodels often struggle to fully comprehend the context embedded\\nwithin questions, which can lead to responses that do not align\\nprecisely with the user’s intentions. Furthermore, language models\\nencounter challenges related to \"hallucinating\" information, i.e.,\\ngenerating entirely fictional facts. Another issue is that the train-\\ning datasets may not be updated regularly, potentially leading to\\nincorrect outputs. To address these challenges, one effective ap-\\nproach is using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which\\nintegrates the advantages of retrieval-based methods to access up-\\nto-date information with generation-based models for coherent and\\ncontext-aware responses. This hybrid method helps mitigate issues\\nrelated to outdated data and enhances the model’s ability to provide\\naccurate and relevant information.\\nTo further advance beyond the traditional RAG framework, Graph-\\nRAG introduces a novel enhancement by integrating knowledge\\ngraphs (KGs). By leveraging the structured relationships and rich\\nsemantics within knowledge graphs, GraphRAG not only improves\\nthe retrieval process but also enables more nuanced and contextu-\\nally aware responses. This incorporation of KGs allows the model\\nto understand complex queries better and provide more detailed\\nand interconnected information, thereby pushing the boundaries\\nof what RAG frameworks can achieve.\\nKG is a structured representation of knowledge that captures\\nrelationships between data points within a specific domain. This\\nstructure is composed of nodes that represent entities and edges\\nthat depict the relationships between these entities, forming an\\ninterconnected information. KGs are effective tools for organizing\\nand integrating vast amounts of data from various sources, enhanc-\\ning the accessibility and usability of this information. They play a\\ncrucial role in improving search engines by providing structured,\\ninterconnected search results, thereby offering users more relevant\\nand comprehensive answers [1, 10].

This approach allows for a deeper\\nunderstanding of the retrieved information, leading to more accu-\\nrate and context-aware responses. By structuring knowledge in a\\ngraph format, GraphRAG can reason over interconnected data, pro-\\nviding richer insights and more coherent outputs [9]. This method\\ninvolves a retrieval module that sources additional data from exter-\\nnal repositories, creating a \"grounding context\" that is integrated\\ninto the LLM’s prompt. By incorporating this context, the model can\\ngenerate responses that are not only more accurate but also more\\nrelevant to specific queries [3, 16]. In GraphRAG, the integration of\\nKGs with LLMs significantly boosts their accuracy and reliability,\\nensuring that the outputs are both precise and trustworthy [8].\\nIt is worth noting that while RAG systems based on SQL are\\nhighly capable, the advantages of using a graph-based structure\\nare: more accurate responses and reduced retrieval times. In fields\\nsuch as digital content creation, news generation, and chatbots (like\\nthe current study) the ability to provide correct answers is crucial,\\nparticularly because language models can sometimes generate hal-\\nlucinations. One of the key strengths of a graph-based approach is\\nthat it adds a greater level of detail to the dataset. This additional\\nlayer enables better data representation and helps mitigate hallu-\\ncinations by improving the model’s ability to find relevant and\\naccurate connections. Furthermore, graph structures make it easier\\nto identify nodes and their related edges, which streamlines data\\nretrieval and results in shorter response times. The combination of\\nimproved accuracy and faster response times is a major reason for\\nthe growing interest in graph-based systems for language models.\\nThese systems are particularly effective in applications where accu-\\nracy and timeliness are critical, providing a robust solution to some\\nof the limitations inherent in more traditional retrieval methods.\\nApplying GraphRAG models requires the expertise of a graph\\ntheory specialist to construct KGs tailored to each dataset.

By constructing KGs from\\nthis dataset, Structured-GraphRAG improves both the precision\\nand ease of process in natural language queries. The results of our\\nexperiments show that compared to traditional RAG methods ap-\\nplied to the same dataset [17], Structured-GraphRAG offers several\\nkey advantages.

To begin using the framework,\\nthe initial step is to create KGs from the source dataset. A complete\\nexplanation of the KGs structures is provided in Section 4. For now,\\nlet’s assume the KGs have been created, and we want to utilize\\nthem. These KGs are designed to provide accurate and detailed\\ninformation from the source dataset and are stored in a graph\\ndatabase such as Neo4j. In this research, we employed the Neo4j\\nPython driver to establish and manage connections with the Neo4j\\ndatabase, enabling efficient query execution and manipulation of\\ngraph data. This integration is part of our Python-based analytical\\nframework.\\nOnce the KGs are set up, the system is prepared for user interac-\\ntion. When a user asks a question, Structured-GraphRAG processes\\nthis query using an LLM. The LLM translates the user’s natural\\nlanguage query into a Cypher query, which is a specialized query\\nlanguage for interacting with graph databases. The Cypher query\\nis then used by a smart search tool, which navigates through the\\ngraph database to identify relevant nodes and edges, effectively\\npinpointing the most pertinent pieces of information from the con-\\nstructed KGs. This process allows the system to extract specific data\\npoints and relationships that directly address the user’s query. After\\nretrieving this data, the system combines it with the context of the\\nuser’s original question and re-inputs it into the LLM. The LLM\\nutilizes this combined information to generate a comprehensive and\\nnuanced response, providing the user with a detailed answer that\\nis both accurate and informative. Figure 1 illustrates the complete\\nprocess, from query to the final response.'),\n",

By doing so, we\\naim to highlight the advantages of using graph-based approaches\\nfor knowledge representation and retrieval, including enhanced\\nquery capabilities, improved data integration, and more intuitive\\nexploration of complex datasets.\\nExample: Suppose a user submits the following query: \"Give\\nme the total home goals for Bayern Munich in the 2014-15 season. \"\\n• Step 1. The KGs as described in Section 4 are created from\\nthe SoccerNet dataset and stored in Neo4j. It is important to\\nmention that the KGs creation from the dataset occurs only\\nonce, and when using the framework, we actually begin\\nfrom Step 2.\\n• Step 2. To extract relevant information from our KGs, the\\nfirst task is to translate the user query into a format that\\nthe KGs can process. This involves using an LLM to convert\\nthe natural language query into a Cypher query, a special-\\nized language for querying graph databases. In this Cypher\\nquery, elements of the user query are mapped to nodes and\\nedges within the KGs. For instance, ’goal’ is treated as an\\n’Event’ node, ’Bayern Munich’ as a ’Team’ node, and the\\nrelationship between them as an ’ASSOCIATED_TO’ edge.\\nThe Cypher query then searches for a ’Game’ node with\\nthe attributes ’season’ set to 2014-2015 and ’home_team’ as\\nBayern Munich, which is linked to an ’Event’ node via an\\n’IS_PART_OF’ edge. This process is illustrated in Figure 14\\n(Generated Cypher).\\n• Step 3. The Cypher query generated in Step 1 is executed\\nagainst the KG, retrieving the relevant nodes and edges. The\\ndetails of this execution and the retrieved data are provided\\nin the ‘Full Context’ section of Figure 14.\\n• Step 4. Finally, the initial user query, along with the re-\\ntrieved data from the ’Full Context, ’ are fed into the LLM.\\nUsing this combined information, the LLM generates the\\nanswer, which is shown in the ‘Result’ section of Figure 14.\\nFigure 14: Sample of a Q&A application.\\n6 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of Structured-GraphRAG\\nand provide an in-depth analysis.

However,\\nit is also crucial to demonstrate that these structures, while being\\nhighly informative, are not excessively complex. To illustrate the\\nsimplicity of these graphs, we use the concept density from graph\\ntheory.\\nDefinition: Suppose that 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸 )is a directed graph, where\\n|𝑉|represents the number of nodes, and |𝐸|represents the number\\nof edges. The density of 𝐺 is shown by 𝐷(𝐺)and defined as the\\nratio of the number of directed edges to the maximum possible\\nnumber of directed edges.\\n𝐷(𝐺)= |𝐸|\\n|𝑉|×(|𝑉|−1).\\nThe density of a directed graph ranges from 0 to 1, where a lower\\ndensity indicates a graph with fewer edges relative to the number\\nof possible edges, making it simpler and less computationally de-\\nmanding to manage. This simplicity is particularly advantageous\\nwhen working with large datasets, as it allows for faster processing\\nand retrieval of information. In our framework, the low densities\\nof the Labels KG (2.85 ×10−6) and the Captions KG (4.47 ×10−4)\\nindicate that these graphs are sparse, meaning they have very few\\nedges compared to the maximum number of possible edges. Such\\nsparsity is crucial for efficiency because it reduces the computa-\\ntional overhead required to traverse the graph and locate relevant\\nnodes and edges. The sparsity of the Label and Caption KGs ensures\\nthat our framework can quickly identify and retrieve the necessary\\ninformation without being bogged down by an excessive number\\nof irrelevant connections. Therefore, our designed KGs structure\\nsignificantly enhances the system’s performance, enabling it to\\nhandle large-scale data efficiently.\\n6.2 Execution Time\\nAs previously discussed, our KGs are optimal, leading to a sub-\\nstantial reduction in execution time. To illustrate this reduction,\\nwe conduct a performance comparison with a recently published\\npaper [17], which utilized the same dataset as our study. The key\\ndistinction between the two approaches lies in how the data is\\nprocessed: while the authors of [17] analyze the dataset in its raw\\nform, our method first transforms the data into KGs before perform-\\ning analysis. This comparison clearly demonstrates the superior\\nperformance of our KG-based approach in reducing execution time\\ncompared to the direct data analysis method employed in [17].'),\n",

This functionality is crucial\\nas it significantly reduces the occurrence of errors associated with\\nretrieving incorrect data due to input mistakes.\\nWithin the Player-Facts KG structure, some players are repre-\\nsented both as attributes within event nodes and as separate nodes\\nconnected to these events. This design aims to minimize hallucina-\\ntions that can occur when generating Cypher queries with LLMs.\\nThe KGs developed here are dynamic, allowing for updates with\\nnew data and adaptation as new information becomes available\\nregarding game events, players, teams, coaches, referees, and sta-\\ndiums. Additionally, this method for constructing KG structures\\nis flexible and adaptable to various structured datasets, making it\\nsuitable for creating KG structures from different sources.\\nThe Structured-GraphRAG framework presented in this paper is\\nadaptable to various datasets and can be utilized for querying data\\nfrom other datasets. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied it\\nto the SoccerNet dataset [7].\\nAs illustrated in Table 5, Structured-GraphRAG outperforms the\\nmethod presented in [17] on Questions 4 and 5. This highlights\\nthe advantage of employing a graph-based approach, where the\\nsmart search efficiently locates nodes with the desired attributes.\\nConsequently, this reduces processing time and enhances answer\\naccuracy. However, for tasks involving listing, the performance\\nof our framework is comparable to that of the method in [17].\\nOne of the challenges in Structured-GraphRAG using LLM lies in\\nhandling questions that ask for lists. In such cases, while the LLM\\ncan generate the correct Cypher query and retrieve all relevant\\nanswers, it often fails to present the complete list.\\nOur results in Figure 14 differ from those obtained through a\\nGoogle search. This discrepancy arises because our dataset is Soc-\\ncerNet, and we have only analyzed games from this specific dataset.\\n8 CONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduced Structured-GraphRAG, a novel frame-\\nwork designed to enhance data retrieval across various structured\\ndatasets by utilizing the capabilities of KGs and graph-based archi-\\ntectures.

Our results demonstrate that Structured-GraphRAG not\\nonly improves precision and reduces hallucinations in language\\nmodels but also optimizes query performance and reduces response\\ntimes. These advanced data retrieval techniques pave the way for\\napplications in diverse fields, showcasing the versatility and adapt-\\nability of Structured-GraphRAG.\\nAdditionally, by addressing the challenges of traditional graph-\\nbased methods, particularly the need for domain-specific expertise\\nin KG design, we present a more accessible approach to graph\\nconstruction for structured datasets, broadening its usability to a\\nwider range of users.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Xiaojun Chen, Shengbin Jia, and Yang Xiang. 2020.
