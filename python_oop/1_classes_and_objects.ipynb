    "\n",
    "Here's a quick recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (e.g., our `Car` class).\n",
    "*   **Object**: An *instance* of a class. A real thing built from the blueprint (e.g., `my_tesla`, `my_ferrari`). Each object has its own data.\n",
    "*   `__init__`: The special *constructor* method that runs when you create a new object. It's perfect for setting up initial attributes.\n",
    "*   **Attributes**: Variables that belong to an object (e.g., `my_tesla.color`). They represent the object's state.\n",
    "*   **Methods**: Functions that belong to an object (e.g., `my_tesla.start_engine()`). They represent the object's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a powerful paradigm that helps you write organized, reusable, and more manageable code."
